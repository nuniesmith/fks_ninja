=== COMMISSION CALCULATION EXAMPLES ===

Scenario 1: 4 trades per day, 50% win rate
- 2 wins × $150 = $300
- 2 losses × $75 = $150
- Gross profit: $150
- Commission: 4 × $5 = $20
- Net profit: $130

Scenario 2: 6 trades per day, 65% win rate
- 4 wins × $175 = $700
- 2 losses × $90 = $180
- Gross profit: $520
- Commission: 6 × $5 = $30
- Net profit: $490

=== MONITORING METRICS ===

Track these commission-specific metrics:
- Net profit per trade (after commissions)
- Commission as % of gross profit (target <10%)
- Break-even win rate (accounting for commissions)
- Average trade duration (longer = better commission efficiency)

=== DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST ===

1. Set commission to $5 in NinjaTrader
2. Use optimized parameters above
3. Enable higher timeframe confirmation
4. Monitor first week carefully
5. Adjust if commission ratio exceeds 15% of gross profit

Remember: In a commission environment, fewer, higher-quality trades 
are always better than many marginal trades.
